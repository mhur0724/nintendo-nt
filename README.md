<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

 ![nintendo-nt-mock](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86213479/149601733-f4a45a19-8970-4cef-8bf0-76482c219b3f.png)

 
The goal of the project was mainly get better at using media queries and designing websites using a mobile-first approach. But I really tried focusing on clean code in order to make everything as easy to read as possible. 

I also wanted to ensure that it was *somewhat* scaleable. You can see this specifically during the side-scroll sections that show various games. It uses JS to call some json files in the "objects" folder. That way you can add/remove any slides that you want to by appending any object to the json file and not the html.
 
I spent a solid 3 weeks on this project and I'm SUPER happy with the way it came out. If you have any feedback or advice on how to better format my code I'd love to hear it!

Note: There are no actual links on any of the clickable items and the input field doesn't look up anything.**
